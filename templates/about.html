## 📘 About SmartCourse

**SmartCourse** is an AI-powered course recommendation system designed to help learners discover relevant educational content based on their personal interests and learning goals. The system leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques to understand user preferences expressed in natural language and recommend the most suitable courses accordingly.

Unlike traditional recommendation systems that rely solely on keyword matching, SmartCourse integrates **two complementary recommendation approaches** to ensure accurate, diverse, and context-aware results.

## 🧠 Intelligent Recommendation Approach

SmartCourse implements a **dual-model architecture**:

### 🔹 TF-IDF Content-Based Model

This model focuses on **keyword relevance** by analyzing exact terms and phrases in course descriptions. It uses:

* TF-IDF vectorization with uni-grams and bi-grams
* Cosine similarity for relevance scoring

This approach performs well when users provide **clear, specific keywords**, such as technologies or programming languages.

---

### 🔹 Neural Semantic Model

The neural model uses **sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)** to generate dense semantic embeddings for course descriptions and user queries. It:

* Understands **conceptual meaning** rather than exact words
* Captures relationships between similar topics
* Produces more flexible recommendations for **complex or vague queries**

This allows SmartCourse to recommend relevant courses even when different terminology is used.

---

## ⚙️ System Workflow

1. The user enters learning preferences in natural language
2. The selected recommendation model processes the query
3. Course descriptions are analyzed and compared using similarity measures
4. The system returns the **top 10 most relevant courses** with relevance scores
5. Users can save recommendations and review their search history

Each query is processed independently, ensuring **fresh and unique recommendations** every time.

---

## 🗂 Dataset Information

The system is built using a large-scale **Course Recommendation System Dataset** containing over **8,500 courses**.
Each course record includes:

* Course Title
* University
* Department
* Difficulty Level
* Course Rating
* Detailed Course Description

The dataset was carefully cleaned and preprocessed to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize textual data for reliable model performance.

---

## 🧪 Performance Evaluation

SmartCourse evaluates both recommendation models using:

* Precision@K
* Recall@K
* Qualitative comparison of recommendation relevance

The comparison highlights how **TF-IDF excels in keyword-based searches**, while the **Neural model performs better in semantic and intent-based queries**.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* **Backend:** Python, Flask, SQLite
* **Machine Learning & NLP:** Scikit-learn, spaCy, Sentence-Transformers
* **Frontend:** HTML5, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript
* **Development Tools:** PyCharm, Git

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of SmartCourse is to enhance the learning discovery experience by providing **accurate, personalized, and intelligent course recommendations**, demonstrating the practical application of NLP and machine learning in educational technology.
